# Surviveee....

## Introduction
You are stuck on a deserted island and must make your way out. Choose an option A or B to find your
way off the island. Choose options wisely, as they determine the skills that you are able to learn.
Be careful, the wrong options can land you in some serious trouble!

This is a text based survival game demonstrating the concept of non-deterministic finite automata. 
There are different scenarios you come across based on choices you make. You need to make chain of
choices that leads to your survival. Some choices leads to your death as well.
that leads to other scenarios corresponds to transitions to different states from a state based
on input.

## Concept
* All the scenarios and transitions from one scenario to another in the game corresponds to NFA.
* Each scenario in the game corresponds to a state in NFA.
* The different options of each scenario that leads to other scenarios corresponds to transitions
  to different states from a state based on the input.
* The win scenario corresponds to end state in NFA.
* The dead scenario corresponds to dead state in NFA.
